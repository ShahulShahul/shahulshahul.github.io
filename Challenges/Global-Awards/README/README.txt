This is completly created on my mobile phone using 
"ACODE EDITOR" and "GOOGLE CHROME"

I don't know how much responsive is this due to above reason

I am used "BOOTSTRAP V4" and also an External Style sheet 

[Every time my style.css file is refreshing the linear gradient's direction text's space is gone hence that colours not showing {eg: "to right" become "toright" i think it will not be present in laptop.} ]

I am added two images that shows how it look like in my phone 

Thank You :)
